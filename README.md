Machine Learning 1
First machine learning project, finished 5/17/2024.

This project is divided into three general sections:
- classification models (supervised learning)
- regression models (supervised learning)
- unsupervised learning
See README_notes.md for an overall project description, and the README.md in eanh section for specifics.
- 
The project includes a number of changes and additions to the original video:
- the code is rewritten in PyCharm (from Colab notebook) with the necessary changes for printing, plotting, and sequencing.
- URLs to additional information (e.g. neural networks) is included
- many additional comments are added
- code for each section is separated into several .py files by function for clarity.

Overall, this was a good first exposure to machine language processing:
- light on theory, which is easily available from many sources.
- discussion of ML packages such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch




This project follows a tutorial by Kylie Ying (https://www.youtube.com/c/YCubed) on the channel "freeCodeCamp.org" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg) (~4 hours)
