NOTE: code well commented!
1. Prepare data: (fcc_MAGIC_example_1.py)
   - load and preprocess (scale and balance)
   - split into three arrays: train, validate, and test (line 43)
Classification models (fcc_MAGIC_example_2.py)
2. Train models (first several from sci-learn)
   - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) - sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier
   - Naive Bayes:
   - Logistic Regression:
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Regression models
3. Code sets split at this point; 'NN' versions have single-arg and grid code
   - Neural Networks:

   - Tensorflow:
   - Classification NN using Tensorflow:
   - Linear Regression:
   - Lin Regression using a Neuron:
   - Regression NN using Tensorflow:
4. Unsupervised learning models
   - K-Means Clustering:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
