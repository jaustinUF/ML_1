NOTE: code well commented!
Classification models: fcc_MAGIC_example_xxx
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope
1. Prepare data:
   - load and preprocess (scale and balance)
   - split into three arrays: train, validate, and test (line 43)
Classification models (fcc_MAGIC_example_2.py)
2. Train models (first several from sci-learn)
   - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) - sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier
   - Naive Bayes:
   - Logistic Regression:
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Data set (magic04.data) (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope)
    row is data sample
    first ten columns are 'features': information
    'class' column is the label, the classification from the features
This would be 'training' data: features already 'categorized' with a label.

Good introductory tutorial on training models!
